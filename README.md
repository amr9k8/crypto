# C++ Cryptography Library
## Description: 
### This is a cryptography library implemented in C++ that provides basic encryption and decryption functionality using popular cryptographic algorithms.

#### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):
##### A symmetric block cipher that uses a fixed block size of 128 bits and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. AES is widely used for encrypting sensitive data and is considered to be very secure.
